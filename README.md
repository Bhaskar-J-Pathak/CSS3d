# CSS3D

**CSS3D** is a personal exploration into the power of pure CSS for building 3D environments—without relying on JavaScript libraries like Three.js. This project pushes the boundaries of what's possible using only CSS transforms, perspectives, and animations.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To experiment with and demonstrate the **3D capabilities of CSS**—no JavaScript rendering engines, just pure HTML and CSS magic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Transform, Perspective, Animation, Keyframes)

## 💡 Features

- Fully 3D visual effects with **no JavaScript**  
- Interactive or animated scenes using only **CSS transitions and transforms**  
- Modular, minimal code for ease of experimentation and learning
